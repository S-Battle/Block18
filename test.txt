Multiplication Test

var value = Multiply( num1, num2);

Multiply(0, 0) should be 0
Multiply(-1, -1) should be 1
Multiply(0, 1) should be 0
Multiply(2, 2) should be 4
Multiply(-2, 2) should be -4
Multiply(0, a) should be error
Multiply(o, 1) should be error
Multiply(1.5, .5) should be 2.25
Multiply(0.1, 1) should be .1
Multiply("start", "start") should be error






Concat Odds Test 

var array[] = concatOdds([num, num, num ....])

concatOdds([2,4,6,8,10],[2,4,6,8,10]) should be []
concatOdds([1,3,5],[7,9,11]) should be [1,3,5,7,9,11]
concatOdds([a,b,c],[d,e,f,g]) should be []
concatOdds([{1},{3}],[{5},{7},{9},{11}]) should be []    ....Only adds numbers to the array, not objects
concatOdds([[1,3],[5,7],[9,11]) should be [] .....Only concats two arrays
concatOdds([-1,-3,-5],[-7,-9,-11]) should be [-1,-3,-5,-7,-9,-11] ....Should work with negative integers
concatOdds([1.1,3.3],[5.5,7.7,9.9,11.11]) should be [] ........only integer numbers can be even or odd
concatOdds(["1,3,5"],["7,9,11"]) should be []  Only adds numbers to the array, not string
concatOdds(["1","3","5"],["7","9","11"]) should be [] only adds numbers to the array, not characters
concatOdds([-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]) should be [-1]







Checkout Option

button.checkout;

if(login){
user = account;
} = user is logged in under account;

if(!login){
user = guest;
